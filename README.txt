Target 1

Goals that can apply to a "books by author name" view:
(2) A. A minimal solution looks just like the title pages in the starter code.
Extract the author for now by taking the creator field up to the first comma: Dickens, Charles, 1812-1870 -> Dickens
(2) B. A satsifactory solution has the P2 paging system integrated in the results.

Goals that need to be an "authors by author name" view:
(2) E. A better solution keeps authors with the same last name (but different first names) separate, as possible (the identity of the Author class is based on first and last name).
(4) F. A great system extracts authors from the title (e.g. after the word by) if not available in the creator field.
(4) G. A great system has two-levels of pages, because there is now an Author class.
At the first level, links to each author are available, with a count of books by each.
At the second level, books by that author are available.
